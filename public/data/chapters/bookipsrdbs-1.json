It also provides introduction to many motivating data sets which are used as running examples throughout the book. An accessible discussion is also provided to debate issues like: \"Lies, damned lies and statistics\" and \"Figures don't lie but liars can figure.\"\n\n## Visual Examples\n\n![Mean and Median Comparison](/images/books/bookipsrdbs/chapter1/mean-median.png)\n*Figure 1.1: Comparison of mean and median in different data distributions*\n\n![Standard Deviation Visualization](/images/books/bookipsrdbs/chapter1/std-dev.png)\n*Figure 1.2: Visual representation of standard deviation in a normal distribution*\n\n![Example Dataset Distributions](/images/books/bookipsrdbs/chapter1/dataset-dist.png)\n*Figure 1.3: Distribution patterns in example datasets used throughout the book*\n\n![Statistical Misrepresentation](/images/books/bookipsrdbs/chapter1/stats-misuse.png)\n*Figure 1.4: Common examples of statistical misrepresentation in media*\n"}
